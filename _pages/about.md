Greetings! Welcome to Zhidong's personal website.

I am an experienced researcher in the fields of structural engineering and structural health monitoring. My interests are computational mechanics, computer vision, data analytics, and open-source software.  I would like to advance resilient, healthy, and sustainable infrastructure with mechanics-based, data-driven approaches.

I enjoy playing badminton, hiking, and cooking.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
